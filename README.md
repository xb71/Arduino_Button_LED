# LED & Button Arduino Project

A fun little Arduino experiment where each button controls its own LED.  
Press → LED lights up.  
Release → LED turns off. Simple as that.

## What’s Inside?

- `button_led_control.ino` → the Arduino sketch.  
- `circuit_diagram.png` → quick wiring reference.  
- `README.md` → this file.

## Stuff You’ll Need

- Arduino Uno (or any clone).  
- 3 push buttons.  
- 3 LEDs (pick your favorite colors).  
- Resistors: 220Ω for LEDs, 1kΩ for buttons.  
- A breadboard & jumper wires.

## How to Try It Out

1. Build the circuit following the diagram.  
2. Upload the code with Arduino IDE.  
3. Press any button — watch the LED react instantly.

## Why This Project?

Perfect starter project to understand:  
- digital inputs (buttons)  
- digital outputs (LEDs)  
- the magic of resistors
